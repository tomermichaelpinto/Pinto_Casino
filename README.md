# Pinto_Casino_Intro

My (serious) first programming project, that was conducted in the programming language Python. The "Pinto Casino" program includes the games "Slot Machine" & "Blackjack".
I had that project done before the Data Structures and Algorithms course, therefore the program does not reflect code efficiency rules.
The reason I chose the program that simulates a casino (even though many will see gambling as a negative thing) was to practice a programming with multiple loops, examining many cases and the responses accordingly.

Hope you would like the project,
Best regards,
Tomer Pinto


#Project_Activation

To activate the project it's required to download the project files "casino" and "games_library", activate the program "casino" and calling the function by typing "casino()",
and then the project will guide you on how to pick the game you want to play or how to leave.
